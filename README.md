# S-expression parser and serializer for PHP

A simple class to work with [S-expressions](http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/S-expression) 
(symbolic expressions). From the Wikipedia:

> S-expressions or sexps (for "symbolic expression") are list-based data structures that 
  represent semi-structured data. An S-expression may be a nested list of smaller 
  S-expressions. S-expressions are probably best known for their use in the Lisp family 
  of programming languages.

Note that this parser is not suitable to work with very large files (several megabytes and
above), since the whole file is parsed and stored in a memory structure based on arrays.


## Supported syntax

This implementation supports the following syntax (in BNF format):

	<sexpr>    	:: <string> | <list>
	<string>   	:: <token> | <base64> | <hex> | <quoted> ;
	<token>    	:: <tokenchar>+ ;
	<base64>  	:: "|" ( <alpha> | <digit> | "+" | "/" | "=" )* "|" ;
	<hex>   	:: "#" ( <digit> | "A" ... "F" | "a" ... "f" | <space> )* "#" ;
	<quoted> 	:: "\"" <bytes> "\"" | "'" <bytes> "'" ;
	<list>     	:: "(" ( <sexp> | <space> )* ")" ;
	<tokenchar> :: <alpha> | <digit> | <punc> ;
	<space>		:: ( " " | "\t" | "\r" | "\n" )* ;
	<digit>		:: "0" ... "9" ;
	<alpha>     :: "A" ... "Z" | "a" ... "z" | <digit> ;
	<punc> 		:: "-" | "." | "/" | "_" | ":" | "*" | "+" | "=" ;
	<comment>	:: ";" <bytes> -- until the end of line


## Example s-expression syntax

	(foo
		"this is a \"quoted\" string"
		"also supporting\nnew lines"
		"The following number will be automatically casted to an integer"
		1231
		"unless you call ->setCastNumbers(false)"
		(bar
			; Line comment
			(int 10) ; This is a comment too
			(float 3.1415)
			(string "foobar")
			(string 'single quotes')
			(base64 |YWJj|)     ; "abc" encoded in base64
			(hex #61 62 63#)    ; "abc" encoded as hex octets			
		)
	)
	
## Library usage

	$sexp = new \DrSlump\Sexp();
	
	// Parse an s-expression and return an array with the data
	$arr = $sexp->parse('(foo (bar 10) baz)');
	
	print_r($arr);
	
	// Array
  	// (
	//    [0] => foo
	//    [1] => Array
	//        (
	//            [0] => bar
	//            [1] => 10
	//        )
	//
	//    [2] => baz
	// )
	
	// Serialize an array structure into an s-expression string
	$exp = $sexp->serialize($arr);
